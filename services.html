          <h2>Recruitment</h2>
          <p>Full cycle recruitment or any aspect of it.  I can create the job posting and post the job in various places.  I can recommend some low cost ways to advertise that is still effective. I can screen applications, conduct phone screens to narrow the pile even more, conduct face to face interviews or recommend good interview techniques. I can provide testing (skill or personality), and conduct reference and background checks.  If your company is not currently using an applicant tracking system (a computer system that manages applications) and would like to learn more about them, I can assist with that as well.</p>

          <h2>Onboarding</h2>
          <p>Onboarding is more than just getting the required paperwork and desk and computer set up new employee on their first day.  It is teaching them about the culture and expectations of the company.  It is making them feel welcome.  It is making sure there is someone that is guiding them and answering questions in the first few months of work.  It is setting them up for success.</p>

          <p>My background in training is conducting employee orientations, teaching about company culture, and software training primarily in Microsoft Office.  However, as long as I can learn the material that needs to be taught, I can certainly provide other types of training.  Sometimes a group format is better but sometimes one of one training is better.  You choose!</p>

          <h2>Employee Retention Strategies</h2>
          <p>There is a talent shortage in various industries.  As more and more baby boomers retire, this will just get worse.  Employees will jump to other jobs if they think things will be better there.  The cost of recruiting and training new people is very expensive.  That is why it is important for companies to have strategies to try and retain their current employees.</p>

          <h2>Business Process Analysis and Office Organization</h2>
