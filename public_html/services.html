          <h2>Recruitment and Selection </h2>
          <h3>Hiring the Right Person</h3>
          <p>Do you need help recruiting and hiring new employees? Don't get bogged down screening applications when you could be concentrating on other aspects of your job. Or utilize my skills during those busy times when you need to hire several people in a short time frame.  Providing full cycle recruitment,  my services include sourcing candidates, writing  job postings, advertising, screening applications, conducting phone screens, face-to-face interviews, testing, police background checks and reference checks. </p>
          <h3>Software</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If your company is not currently using an applicant tracking system (ATS), call me to find out how to streamline your recruitment process to manage the flood of applications and the other busy stages.</p>

          <h2>Training and Development</h2>
          <h3>Orientations / Onboarding</h3>
          <p>Would you like someone to conduct Orientations to teach new employees everything they need to know about your company during those crucial first few weeks? Or someone to help with the onboarding process?  Onboarding is more than just getting the required paperwork filled out and setting up a desk and computer for a new employee. It is about explaining the culture and expectations of the company, and making them feel welcome. It is about making sure there is someone that is guiding them and answering questions in the first few months of work.   If you don't have a good onboarding plan in place, call me to help set up your new employees for success.</p>
          <h3>Employee Development</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">To be successful, employees need ongoing training to improve technical and human skills.  Training may also be needed for succession planning within an organization.  Do you have a plan in place or do you need help with organizing, managing, or assisting in this area?</p>

          <h2>Administrative / Projects / General <br />
          </h2>
          <h3> Planning Events / Projects</h3>
          <p>I love planning and organizing. Do you have a project or event that you need someone to take on or need extra help with?   Let me tackle some of those extra jobs that are challenging to  get done.</p>
          <h3>Administrative</h3>
          <p>Let me look after administrative tasks such as  maintaining employee files, data entry, generating reports, creating manuals, setting up mail merges, handling bulk mailings, scheduling meetings, booking travel, or any  jobs you do not have time to do yourself.</p>
          <h3>Other</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">  Human Resources encompasses a lot of areas. I can  assist with employee relations,  performance reviews, payroll, benefits or any other related tasks you may have. My business background also gives me knowledge in roles outside of HR including basic bookkeeping,   purchasing, research,  and writing. If you have a need for a service that I have not listed here, please <a href="about.html">inquire</a> as I may be able to help!</p>
