          <h2>Recruitment</h2>
          <p>Are there times that you need to hire a lot of people at once and could use extra help in recruiting?  Or perhaps you are hiring one person but don't want to get bogged down in screening through applications when you could be concentrating on other aspects of your job.  I can provide full cycle recruitment or any aspect of it.  This can range from writing the job postings, advertising, screening applications, conducting phone screens, face-to-face interviews, testing, police background checks and reference checks.  I can recommend low cost ways of advertising that are still effective and recommend good interview techniques.  If your company is not currently using an applicant tracking system (ATS) and would like to learn more about them, I can assist with that as well.</p>

          <h2>Onboarding</h2>
          <p>Onboarding is more than just getting the required paperwork and desk and computer set up new employee on their first day.  It is teaching them about the culture and expectations of the company.  It is making them feel welcome.  It is making sure there is someone that is guiding them and answering questions in the first few months of work.  It is setting them up for success.</p>

Or perhaps you would like someone to train the employees various software, like Microsoft Office, that your company uses to do their jobs better and be more efficient.   I can help in this area or possible other material that you want to train your employees.  Sometimes a group format is better but sometimes one of one training is better.  You choose!</p>

          <h2>Employee Retention</h2>
          <p>There is a talent shortage in various industries.  As more and more baby boomers retire, this will just get worse.  Employees will jump to other jobs if they think things will be better there.  The cost of recruiting and training new people is very expensive.  That is why it is important for companies to have strategies to try and retain their current employees.</p>
